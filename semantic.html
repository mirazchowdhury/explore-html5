        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is
            the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup
            language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This
            language is used to annotate (at the note for computer) text so that a machine can understand it and
            manipulate text accordingly. Most of the markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable. The language uses
            tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. It is used for structuring and presenting the
            content on the web pages. HTML5 is the fifth version of HTML. Many elements are removed or modified from
            HTML5 </p>
